Put lake surface temperature and aerial ice concentration from GLERL-provided FVCOM forecast files (which have already been mapped to the FV3-LAM grid) into sfc_data\&.nc\&. This script will take two variables from the command line:
.IP "1." 4
Name of FV3 sfc data file (e\&.g\&. sfc_data\&.tile7\&.halo0\&.nc)
.IP "2." 4
Name of FVCOM data file (e\&.g\&. fvcom\&.nc)
.PP
.PP
To run the script, use the following example, modifying file names as needed: \&./fvcom_to_FV3 sfc_data\&.tile7\&.halo0\&.nc fvcom\&.nc
.PP
Code is strongly based upon Eric James' (ESRL/GSL) work to update HRRR/WRF Great Lakes' temperature data with FVCOM\&. Code also relies heavily on Ming Hu's ncio module\&.
